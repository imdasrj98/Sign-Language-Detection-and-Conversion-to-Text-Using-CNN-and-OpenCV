# Sign-Language-Detection-and-Conversion-to-Text-Using-CNN-and-OpenCV
The project focuses on translating American Sign Language into text using CNN model and OpenCV library of python. The training and testing of the model will done by classical convolutional neural network and then for real time application OpenCV will be used to detect the hand and then the final prediction will be made by the CNN model.
